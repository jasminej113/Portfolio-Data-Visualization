# Store Sales Dashboard:

Objective: This project creates nnovative and interactive Tableau dashboards that focus on potential insights on Store Sales data in the United States. Highlights include categories per sales, quarterly sales trend, sales per state, and sales per city. The client insisted the data to be cleaned using Excel or Python. The Dataset contained missing values and was cleaned using the Python programming language. Tableau dashboards were created from the cleaned dataset.
