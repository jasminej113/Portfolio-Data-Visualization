# Portfolio-Data-Visualization
This repository contains my Data Analytics portfolio projects ranging from SQL, Python, Tableau, Excel

The objective of the project was to create innovative and interactive Tableau dashboards that focus on potential insights on Sales data in USA. Highlights include categories per sales, quarterly sales trend, sales per state, and sales per city. The client insisted the data to be cleaned using Excel or Python. The Dataset contained missing values and was cleaned using the Python programming language. Tableau dashboards were created from the cleaned dataset.
